    <p><strong>OneMaDGame</strong> ("we", "our", "us") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it through this Privacy Policy. This document explains how we collect, use, and disclose information when you use our mobile game <strong>Sudoku</strong> (the "App").</p>

    <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App uses <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to display advertisements. Since the App is available to users of all ages, including children under 13, we have configured AdMob to show only child-friendly, non-personalized ads in compliance with <strong>Google Play Families Policy</strong> and <strong>COPPA</strong> regulations.</p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>Since we do not collect personal information, we do not use or share any personal data. Any data collected by AdMob is handled by Google for non-personalized advertising purposes.</p>

    <h2>4. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our App is designed for users of all ages, including children under 13. We comply with <strong>COPPA</strong> and do not knowingly collect, use, or share personal information from children. If a parent or guardian believes that their child has provided us with personal information, they should contact us immediately so we can take the necessary steps to remove such information.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We do not store any user data on our servers. However, Google AdMob may collect and process data as per its own policies.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with a revised "Effective Date." Your continued use of the App after any modifications constitutes acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.</p>
